Just started working on this site. Added Jekyll because hopefully I might start blogging. I hear its the what the cool kids do nowadays. If you're reading this message chances are I still havent changed anything from just the default settings or I did change everything and forgot to remove this post. I'm hoping to do a few things here, mainly front end stuff. BTW my grammar is terrible. If I do end up doing the blog thing, I'll have to get someone to look over my posts before I post. This might be the only post without any editing. Appreciate the real unadultered me. ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹. 
Anyways, the main reason for this site is actually just that I'd like to have a personal site with some project examples and a bit of info about me. This blog stuff is just because it was easy and maybe I'll get into it. We'll see....


For now:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
print_hello('Everyone')
#=> prints 'Hello, Everyone' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

^^ credits due to the Jekyll welcome post. ðŸ˜¹

<!-- Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
